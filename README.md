# 🎥 Visual Prosthesis Simulation Notebook

**Description:**  
This notebook simulates phosphene-based vision in visual prostheses, allowing users to process images and videos with adjustable neuroprosthetic parameters.

## 🧠 Key Features
- **Phosphene Grid Simulation** – Generates a scattered grid of light spots.
- **Circular Masking** – Simulates restricted tunnel vision.
- **Edge Detection** – Enhances object visibility.
- **Flicker Effect** – Introduces brightness variability in phosphenes.
- **Video Processing** – Applies the simulation to an entire video file.
- **Interactive Widgets** – Allows real-time adjustments.

## 🏛 Course Context
- **[Master in Neurotechnology](https://neurotec.upm.es/en/masters-of-science-in-neurotechnology/)** – [Universidad Politécnica de Madrid](https://www.upm.es/)  
- **Neuroprosthetics Course** – March 2025
